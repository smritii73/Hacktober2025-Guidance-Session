Hacktober Guidance â€” concise checklist and tips

What is Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest is an annual month-long event that encourages contributing to open-source projects by making pull requests (PRs) during October. Itâ€™s a great way to learn, give back, and get visibility â€” but quality matters: maintainers look for useful, well-formed contributions.

Quick rules (summary)

* Event window: October 1â€“31 (local timezone of the host site).
* Required actions: Make valid PRs to public repositories that are tagged or accepted by the event (check event rules for the year).
* PR quality: PRs must be meaningful, adhere to project contribution guidelines, and pass any automated checks to be accepted.
* Respect maintainers: Follow the repositoryâ€™s contribution guide, be patient, and respond to feedback.

Before you start â€” checklist

1. Create/update your GitHub profile (display name, bio, contact).
2. Set up Git locally (username, email) and SSH key or PAT for pushing.
3. Fork repositories you plan to contribute to.
4. Read CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, and README in the repo.
5. Search for issues with labels like `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `hacktoberfest`, `beginner`, `up-for-grabs`.

How to find good issues

* Use GitHub search filters: `label:"good first issue" language:JavaScript state:open` etc.
* Explore repositories you use or care about â€” start with those.
* Check GitHub Topics (e.g., `topic:hacktoberfest` or `topic:good-first-issue`).
* Join communities: Discord/Slack/Reddit of relevant projects or the Hacktoberfest official community.

Types of valuable contributions

* Bug fixes with a test demonstrating the fix.
* Documentation improvements (README, examples, tutorials).
* Tests and test improvements.
* Small features or enhancements (after discussing on an issue/PR).
* Accessibility, i18n, or usability fixes.
* Refactoring that improves readability or reduces complexity.

PR workflow (recommended)

1. Fork the repo to your account.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b fix/short-descriptive-name`.
3. Make minimal, focused commits with clear messages.
4. Run tests and linters locally before committing.
5. Push the branch to your fork.
6. Open a PR from your branch to the original repoâ€™s target branch (usually `main` or `master`).
7. In your PR description: reference the issue (e.g., `Closes #123` if appropriate), explain what you changed and why, list any testing steps.
8. Be responsive to maintainer feedback and update the PR as requested.

PR quality checklist (before opening)

* Does the change solve a clearly described problem?
* Does it follow the repositoryâ€™s style and lint rules?
* Are there tests or instructions for manual testing?
* Is the PR limited in scope (one problem per PR)?
* Is your commit history tidy (squash or rebase if necessary)?

Documentation PRs â€” how to make them useful

* Improve examples that reproduce common tasks.
* Fix typos and broken links.
* Add a short, runnable snippet where possible.
* If adding a new topic, include a rationale and brief usage guide.

Common pitfalls to avoid

* Submitting low-effort or automated PRs that add no lasting value.
* Ignoring or breaking the repositoryâ€™s contribution rules.
* Large PRs touching many unrelated files â€” split them.
* Rewriting code without tests or maintainersâ€™ agreement.

Communicating with maintainers

* Open an issue first for non-trivial changes or features.
* Use clear, polite language and provide screenshots or traces for bugs.
* If a maintainer requests changes, respond promptly and explain if you canâ€™t make them.

If a PR is closed or rejected

* Read the maintainerâ€™s reason carefully.
* Ask clarifying questions if the feedback is unclear.
* Rework and reopen or open a new PR only if you address the feedback.

Automation & tools

* Use GitHub Actions / CI to verify tests and linters.
* Use `prettier`, `eslint`, or language-specific formatters to match style.
* Use `gh` CLI for quick workflows (create PRs, view issues).

Sample PR template (short)
Title: `fix: short description (#issue-number)`

Description:

* What: Briefly describe the change.
* Why: Why this change is needed.
* How tested: Steps or test results.
* Related: Closes #<issue> (if applicable)

Final tips

* Aim for impact over volume: a few high-quality PRs are better than many trivial ones.
* Start with documentation and tests if youâ€™re unsure about codebase rules.
* Learn from review comments â€” theyâ€™re mentorship from experienced maintainers.
* Be courteous: open-source thrives on respectful collaboration.

Resources (quick list)

* Official Hacktoberfest site (check rules each year).
* GitHub labels: `good first issue`, `help wanted`.
* `first-contributions` repo for a guided first PR experience.

Good luck â€” and happy contributing! ðŸŽ‰
